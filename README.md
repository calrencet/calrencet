- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Clarence Thng

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a data analyst who comes from a Law and consulting background in the compliance industry for financial institutions. 
My experience with problem solving using data via Excel got me passionate about improving efficiency through better data handling, analysis, and visualization. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve completed a Data Science Immersive course with General Assembly Singapore to kickstart my transition into the data science industry.

Since then, I've helped to:

- Establish a framework and pipeline for data extraction, cleaning, and consolidation for processing into dashboards and MI reports at Deutsche Bank;
- Created and maintained dashboards for sales reps and managers to track their KPIs on Tableau and Google Looker Studio; (Xero)
- Used SQL and Excel to perform historical analyses to identify trends and increase the accuracy of forecasting formulas, as well as set targets for the coming FYs; (Xero)
- Identify and recommend changes to promo codes based on an analysis of the effectiveness of existing promo codes; (Xero)
- Performed customer segmentation based on metrics such as total accessible market, orgs purchased, and number of inactive orgs; (Xero)
- Worked with the compliance team at Crypto.com to understand and translate regulatory requirements into data requirements, and created and maintained SQL queries for the extraction of such data into reports to be submitted to regulators such as MAS using SQL and Python.
